# vacation-recommender
This is the frontend component of the vacation-recommender app, built in React using Typescript and styled via TailwindCSS.

## Installation Instructions
To get the frontend running on your computer, make sure to create a new terminal, different from the one used to install and run the backend. From there, ensure you are in the `vacation-recommender` directory within the project. If you do not have Node.js already installed on your computer, you can download it via this link: [https://nodejs.org/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download) \
From there, run the following command:
```
$ npm install
```
Note: this may take a while due to everything being downloaded

## Run the frontend
Once everything is installed, launch the website by running the following command in the same terminal as before:
```
$ npm start
```
From there, the website will launch in your browser.
